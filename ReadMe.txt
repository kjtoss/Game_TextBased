This is the ReadMe file for my Text Based Adventure Game, called the Lost Adventurer.

You are lost on a college campus, but there is obviously no way you can know what campus it is.
I mean really.. who has ever heard of these long names like "Champagnat" or "Donnelly."

Pfff.. good luck figuring out where to go!
